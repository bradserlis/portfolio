            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>As a developer, I look for new ways to connect our stories with one another through accessible technologies. I believe everyone has a story to tell â€” a story they are writing, and I am driven to find creative ways to simplify writing that story. I am a dreamer looking to leave an impact on connecting people in ways significant to them. <p>
